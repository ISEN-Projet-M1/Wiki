# Node

## What is Node?

NodeJS is a software platform for executing JavaScript on the server side.

## How do I use my Node service?

1. Create your account on the serveroo.fr website.
2. Go to the *Products* page, select your Starter pack and the Node product.
   Automatic renewal is not currently available. If you wish to extend your experience, it will be possible to extend the service from this page.

3. Once you have made your purchase, you will be redirected directly to the page for your various services. You can therefore see the configuration of your service.

4. To be able to use your service, you need to upload your project to the file part of the service.

> **Tip**

> To make it easier to deploy your project, you can zip it up and upload it.

{style=‘note’}

You can then extract your project from the service's file area.

> File names do not accept special characters or spaces.

The project may take some time to load. We advise you to restart your server. You can also check the loading in the log section.

5. To access your site, all you have to do is enter the connection URL, which can be found at the top of the page for your service.

   This will take you to your project's index.js file.
   To access other pages, simply enter the file tree.

> Warning**
>
> For you to be able to access your project, you need to configure the launch of your node on port 80.
> You can also add the port on which your node runs to the *Port* section of your service page.
> If you add a new port, the access link for your service will be the new external port.
