# Nginx
## What is Nginx?

Nginx is a web server for putting your website online.

## How do I use my Nginx service?

1. Create your account on the serveroo.fr website.
2. Go to the *Products* page, select your Starter pack and the Nginx product.
   Automatic renewal is not currently available. If you wish to extend your experience, it will be possible to extend the service from this page.

3. Once you have made your purchase, you will be redirected directly to the page for your various services. You can therefore see the configuration of your service.

4. To be able to use your service, you need to upload your project to the file part of the service.
