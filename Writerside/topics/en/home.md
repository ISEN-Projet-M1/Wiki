## Low-cost server for students : Serveroo
# Need a server for your student project?

As students at ISEN, we regularly have to carry out group projects that require a server. Whether it's for a ‘Curious Game’ in second year, a multi-player JavaScript project, or even for the research of certain professors, the need for a reliable and affordable server is omnipresent.
